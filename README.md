# L5 Operator demo

The goal is to develop a demo operator with level 5 capabilities to serve as an example to enhance workshop [content](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1l6FY1QdBq1IsmwM6Ib44A8h12OSKGJbe) as well as to present at kubecon for which a [proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GjJgBcJmywP3L64m1h4vZ68UIu-XJxMZ/view?usp=sharing) was submitted. The capabilities are being developed according to our interpretation of the requirements described by the operator capability descriptions given in the operator sdk [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gNa2NQzlsHDdNHBYPczCytkuokEzBCFKjlxM12X5cdk/edit?usp=sharing)
